Simon Game Rules

Simon is a classic memory game that challenges players to repeat a sequence of lights and sounds generated by the game. Here's how it works:

1. Sequence Generation: Simon starts by displaying a sequence of colors and corresponding sounds in a specific order.

2. Player Turn: Players must then repeat the sequence by pressing the colored buttons in the same order.

3. Increasing Difficulty: As the game advances, Simon adds more colors to the sequence, making it longer and more challenging to remember.

4. Game Over: If a player presses the wrong button or makes a mistake in the sequence, the game ends. Players can then start again to try and beat their previous score.

Simon tests and improves memory skills while providing an engaging and competitive gameplay experience. Ready to see how far you can go?
